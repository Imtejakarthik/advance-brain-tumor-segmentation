# advance-brain-tumor-segmentation

Advanced brain tumor segmentation involves the use of deep learning techniques to accurately identify and segment brain tumors from medical images such as MRI scans. The process typically involves training a neural network on a large dataset of labeled images, where the network learns to identify patterns and features that distinguish tumors from healthy tissue.

3D Brain Tumor Segmentation
The 3D brain tumor segmentation uses the BRaTS dataset, which is a volumetric representation of the brain with 4 channels or modalities. The examples implemented are based on a University of Freiburg research team using a head&neck dataset with 7 modalities.

Experiment Manager
The Experiment Manager App can be used to do a Leave-One-Out analysis, as well as, Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter determination. The code demonstrates how to use the Experiment Manager App to do a Leave-One-Out analysis and Bayesian Optimization.

Parameter Sweeping
Parameter sweeping involves modifying the Brain Segmentation code to demonstrate how the Experiment Manager App can be used to do a Leave-One-Out analysis, as well as, Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter determination.

Advanced Features
The code incorporates a number of advanced features which were implemented with a custom training loop and parallel communication and constructs. The two major features are implementing a virtual minibatch size by aggregating losses over sub-iterations which emulate multi-gpu's and background tasks running in the background to facilitate validation and plotting.

U-Net Architecture
The U-Net architecture is used for brain tumor segmentation. The architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is used to extract features from the input image, while the decoder is used to upsample the feature maps to the original image size.

Data Augmentation


# Import necessary libraries
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D, concatenate
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from keras.losses import binary_crossentropy
from keras.metrics import binary_accuracy

# Define the network architecture
inputs = Input((240, 240, 4))
conv1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(inputs)
conv1 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv1)
pool1 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv1)

conv2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(pool1)
conv2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(conv2)
pool2 = MaxPooling
Data augmentation is used to increase the size of the training dataset. The techniques used include flipping, rotation, and scaling.
